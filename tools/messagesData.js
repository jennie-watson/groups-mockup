          "Hi Fellow Travelers. Great to join a group with similar interests to mine. My Husband and I like to do a trip every year but my main ambition is to find someone or a group to walk the Camino de Santiago walk thru France, Spain and Portugal. Its pretty ambitious as to do the whole walk would take 6 weeks plus but you can do stages of it. If you are looking it up you will also find it under the Walk of St James or Pilgrims Walk. Husband is a no goer on this trip as he freaks out at the thought of walking so far each day and roughing it in the Hostels . Any ladies up for the Shanghai airfare of $599? Great shopping but must be quick as it was in last weekends paper.",

On Thursday nights at 6.00pm there is a film shown for free at the Uni by students studying the craft. They are always very highly rated Art House movies. You can get into town very easily at that time of night, Corner of Grafton and Symonds St. This week there is one on Monday night, A Separation:  http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1832382/      Screened in Arts 1, Room 220, on Monday October 10th. When Nader (Payman Maadi), a bank employee, refuses to leave Tehran, his wife, Simin (Leila Hatami) sues for divorce in the hope that she can make a better life for their young daughter abroad. Needing someone to care for his senile father while he's at work, Nader hires Razieh (Sareh Bayat), a married woman whose chador hides her pregnancy. One day, after becoming angry with Razieh, Nader shoves her, and she has a miscarriage, leading Razieh's husband to take Nader to court.  You can park your car in the Uni car parks for free at that time of night. I'd like to think I will go, I'm working in Queen St till 3.00pm.",

However, the Parapara is a NZ native plant that has been decimated by European occupation by introduced  grazing animals from the Auckland area and although not endangered, has pretty much disappeared from the Auckland area - thanks mostly to well intended actions to protect introduced cats and birds.  If you have one on your property - disposing of it is your option, but trying to get neighbours without cats to remove it - then I think we need to be more careful in targeting our eradication efforts.\nMike Rush",

          "Large variation of sewing kits and they are at an affordable price.\r\n\r\nSimple soft toys to make with kids!\r\nSimple hand sewing activities with children!\r\n\r\nThreading is one of the many greatest activities to help children develop strong fine motor skills.\r\nToy Sewing Kits contain everything you need to make cute projects. I have a large variation of sewing kits and they are at an affordable price. All pieces are pre-cut, with premade holes ready for stitching. The kits include strong thread, toy stuffing, safe plastic needles and instructions.\r\nAge: 5 years and up (not suitable for children under 3 years).\r\nIf your kids like to sew, if they want to learn to sew, if they want a cool felt projects to do ….then you can buy these kits. It is a good and quiet activity for rainy days.Children will learn the foundations of sewing and make their own soft toy to hug and love!\r\nContact: Natalia, Tel: 021 02501481, email:softtoynz@Gmail.com",

However I still got my hand in to a few things to keep my creative side nurtured. I'd like to share some pictures of the things I have been busy with, although may not be aligned with what has been previously shared on this page but surely yet an other of my creative expressions when I have very little time to spend on hobbies____. So I have been cooking and sketching. Will share the pics soon.\r\n\r\nHope you all have been keeping well since the last time we interacted. Have you taken up any creative projects lately? Please do share. I see many more have joined the page- a warm welcome to all of the new members and sorry that the page has been so inactive. I also want to thank @[user_1920354]  for putting her craft up while I was away.  Now that we are about 24, lets talk about your recent interest in anything creative. It doesn't have to be a serious craft. Waiting to hear from you all. Have a very nice Autumn day! <3",

It’s always hard moving to a new city and not knowing where the best vet is and who to trust pet sitting while you are on holiday. If you have any suggestions for me I would really appreciate it and please let me know as I want the best care for my babies :)\r\nOne of our boys who was a rescue has no eyes so he requires extra special treatment.",

I wanted to have a better yoga mat free of unnatural and harmful materials (PVCs, heavy metals, phthalates, etc.) that was better for the environment. I have started a line of cork yoga mats which are sustainably made using natural materials (rubber and cork), are naturally anti-microbial and biodegradable. You can find further information at: valka.co.nz... - we also have a sale currently for the long weekend.\r\n\r\nNamaste\r\n\r\nDanny",
